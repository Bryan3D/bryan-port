        Welcome to my website! My name is Bryan A Quero, and I am a highly experienced professional with more than 30 years of experience in the construction industry, over 20 years as a technical artist, and 7+ years in XR and MERN development. With my extensive background in these fields, I offer a unique set of skills that can help bring your project to life.

        Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of construction projects, from large commercial developments to small residential renovations. I have honed my skills in project management, site coordination, and technical drafting, giving me a deep understanding of the building process.

        As a technical artist, I have applied my expertise to the field of computer graphics and animation. My attention to detail and understanding of complex software has allowed me to work on a range of projects, including video games, animated films, and architectural visualizations.

        In recent years, I have also developed a strong expertise in XR and MERN development. I have used these technologies to develop immersive experiences for a range of applications, including games, e-commerce platforms, and enterprise software.

        Overall, I am passionate about using my skills and experience to help bring your project to life. Whether you need help with construction, technical art, or XR/MERN development, I have the skills and expertise to deliver exceptional results. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work.
