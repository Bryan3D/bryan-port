## Project description
---
<p>
The React Portfolio is a web application that allows users to create their personal portfolios using React.js. It is a platform for individuals to showcase their skills, projects, and achievements to potential clients or employers.

The project will have the following features:

- Home Page: This will be the landing page of the website, which will contain the user's name, profile picture, and a brief introduction.

- About Me: The About Me page will provide a detailed description of the user's education, work experience, and other relevant information.

- Skills: This section will display the user's skillset, such as programming languages, tools, and technologies that the user is proficient in.

- Projects: Users can add their projects to this section, along with a description, screenshots, and links to the project repositories.

- Contact Me: This page will contain a form that allows visitors to contact the user for potential work opportunities or collaborations.

- The project will be built using React.js and will be styled with CSS. It will also use third-party libraries such as React Router, React Skillbars and React Bootstrap to enhance the user experience.

The React Portfolio will be deployed on a web server, making it accessible to the public. Users will be able to create an account to edit and update their portfolios easily.

This project will provide individuals with a platform to showcase their skills and experience to potential employers, leading to better career opportunities. Additionally, it will be an excellent tool for freelancers to market themselves and their services to clients.
